## 84% of funds want data-driven deal flow. 1% have it.

I bridge that gap because I've sat on both sides - deploying £250M+ and building the systems that find deals.

***
## Who I work with

Pre-Seed to Series A consumer VC funds. £50M-£500M AUM.

## Services

**Deal sourcing engines & Infrastructure** - Brand discovery & Screening across all consumer categories & geographies. Regular updates, or one off deep dives. 

**Fractional Data Lead** - When you need solutions without a full fledged data team.

**Data advisory** - Building strategies for funds ready to move from manual to systematic deal flow.

**Infrastructure upgrades** - Better databases, knowledge management, and processes.

## How I work 

We agree on deliverables and success criteria upfront. 

1-4 week sprints with weekly deliverables. Everything I build integrates with your existing tools and transfers to your team. No lock-in.
