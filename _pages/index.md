# I build deal sourcing engines that work.

I've deployed £250M+ as a Senior Investor and built the data infrastructure that made it possible. Most funds want data-driven deal flow, very few have it.

I bridge that gap.

"Discuss your project"

## Who I work with

Series A-C consumer VC funds. £50M-£500M AUM. Teams of 3-50 people.

***
### Pricing 

I have zero interest in charging you for work that doesn't solve your problem. You pay based on satisfaction with delivery. No results, no charge. 

We agree on deliverables and success criteria upfront. Projects typically range £3k-£45k depending on scope.
