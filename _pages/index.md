## 84% of funds want data-driven deal flow. 1% have it.

I bridge that gap because I've sat on both sides - deploying £250M+ and building the systems that find deals.

"Discuss your project" 

***
## Who I work with

Series A-C consumer VC funds. £50M-£500M AUM. Teams of 3-50 people.

***
## Pricing 

I complete the project. You decide what it's worth.

We agree on deliverables and success criteria upfront. 

For reference, completed projects have typically been valued between £3k-£45k depending on scope and impact.

***
## How I work 

1-4 week sprints with weekly deliverables. Everything I build integrates with your existing tools and transfers to your team. No lock-in.

## Services

**Deal sourcing engines** - Brand discovery across multiple data sources. Automated, or one off. 

**Fractional CTO/Data Officer** - When you need solutions without a full fledged data team

**Data strategy** - For funds ready to move from manual to systematic deal flow

**Infrastructure upgrades** - Better databases, knowledge management, processes that work
