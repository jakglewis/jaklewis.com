# I build deal sourcing engines that actually work.

I've deployed £250M+ as a Senior Investor and built the data infrastructure that made it possible. Most funds want data-driven deal flow. Almost none have it.

I bridge that gap.

### Pricing 

No results, no charge. You pay based on satisfaction with delivery. 

We agree on deliverables and success criteria upfront. Projects typically range £3k-£45k depending on scope.

I have zero interest in charging you for work that doesn't solve your problem.
